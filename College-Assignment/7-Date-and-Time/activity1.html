        <h3>Date and Time. Activity 1.</h3>
        <p>Create a web page to display the current date and time. Rather than displaying the date and time as a single string, use output elements and Date methods to separately display the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. Set a timer interval so the current time updates automatically every second.</p>
