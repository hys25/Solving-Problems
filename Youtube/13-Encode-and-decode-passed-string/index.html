        <h3>Encode and decode passed string</h3>
        <p>Create an encode function that will accept a string of letters in English. This function should return a string in which vowels are replaced by digits.<br><br>
            a -> 1, e -> 2, i -> 3, o -> 4, u -> 5<br>
            You also need to create a decode function, which will accept the encrypted string and return the recovered string.
